# [MediaShout Script to Text](http://DouglasMeyer.github.com/MediaShoutScriptToText)

This is a helper HTML page to convert a MediaShout script (.ssc) to a format that is ready to print.


## How to use it

Go to [this](http://DouglasMeyer.github.com/MediaShoutScriptToText) page and drag your .scc file into the dashed box. Your script should be ready to print. If you would like to make some changes before printing, do so; the page should be editable.
I hope this is able to help you out. If there is some way this tool could help you out better, [let me know](mailto:DouglasMeyer@mail.com?subject=MediaShout script to text.).


## Why did I make this

This project was created because I needed to print all the songs from a .scc along with scripture references (to help the translator for my church's Spanish ministry). Unfortunately, MediaShout V4 doesn't provide an easy way to do this. 


## What this will do

* Make it easy to print what you want from a .ssc file.

## What this won't do

* Edit or create files to be used in MediaShout
